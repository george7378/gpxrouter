# gpxrouter
GpxRouter allows you to create and edit routes for use with certain apps and GPS devices. It was originally intended to create simple routes to import into the EasyVFR flight navigation app, but the outputs can be used with other software/hardware too. You can export routes in multiple formats, including an auto-generated VFR flight log which can help to calculate headings and leg times.
